                    Hello! My name is Nikko Bustillo. I started out as a medical student following the footsteps of my
                    mother.
                    After a while,
                    I decided for myself that the medical field was not for me. I decided to pursue a different passion
                    and a
                    different
                    drive that would make me happy. While working as a rehab aide technician, I learned how to push and
                    submit
                    electronically
                    signed doctor documents into a cloud. That made me wonder how that system worked and what syntax
                    makes it
                    run.
                    It brought me back That lead me to remembering building website profiles on MySpace that dealt with
                    code.
                    At
                    that moment, I wanted to make that passion into a job that I would be happy with. I was extremely
                    glad and
                    fortunate
                    that Rutgers had a program that could take my passion and drive to the next level.
