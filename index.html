        <p>Dogs are my favorite animal because they are very loyal. They're also very energetic and very fascinating. Dogs have many species and crossbreeds.There are more than 150 dog breeds, divided into 8 classes: sporting, hound, working, terrier, toy, non-sporting, herding, and miscellaneous. According to a recent survey, the most popular name for a dog is Max. Other popular names include Molly, Sam, Zach, and Maggie.
